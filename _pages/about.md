🎓 I'm a senior at UCLA studying computer engineering and math. I'm planning on attending UCLA grad school for computer science, but I'm open to other opportunities!

🔬 I'm primarily interested in AI/ML, computer architecture, blockchain, and SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). I'm planning to focus on ML software in addition to hardware accelerators during grad school. I haven't decided which areas of AI/ML I want to pursue yet.

# Selected Experience

## 👨‍💻 Academic Research

I'm currently working in Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman's Large Scale Machine Learning Group (BigML) Lab as an undergrad student researcher. I'm researching techniques to prevent catastrophic forgetting (CF) while still learning from new data (a different distribution) in LLMs during fine tuning. Using LLM guardrails as a metric for CF.

## ⌨️ Industry

Most recently, I worked as an AI Researcher during an internship at Perceptronics Solutions. While there, I researched ML solutions to a problem with a positioning system and ultimately implemented a NARX neural network in Tensorflow based on a research paper to improve the system's accuracy.

Before that, I worked as a software/DDR5 memory engineer during and internship at Intel. There, I worked on validating server-grade DDR5 DRAM as efficiently as possible. After researching bottlenecks in the pipeline, I implemented a genetic algorithm in Python to obtain optimal duty cycle adjust (DCA) settings faster.

## 👨‍💻 Courses

I have spent most of my undergrad focusing on AI/ML classes. Specifically, I've taken courses in computer vision, NLP, deep learning, and AI theory (propositional and first order logic, Bayesian statistics, etc.). I bring my math background to these classes, most notably through linear algebra, graph theory, and game theory.

Additionally, I've taken courses in SETI and cryptography/blockchain.
