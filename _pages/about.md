🎓 I'm a computer science master's student at UCLA. I'm looking for full time roles following graduation.

🔬 I'm primarily interested in computer architecture and AI/ML, although I have an interest in blockchain as well.

👨‍🏫 I'm the TA for ENGR1: Internet of Things. This course covers embedded ML, sensors, DSP, etc..

# Selected Experience

## 👨‍💻 Academic Research

I'm currently working in Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman's Large Scale Machine Learning Group (BigML) Lab as a graduate researcher. Here, I research security for large models. Specifically, I'm researching techniques to counteract fine tuning attacks on text based models (LLMs) and technqiues to counter SOTA jailbreaking methods for multimodal models (text and image).

## ⌨️ Industry

Most recently, I worked as an AI Researcher during an internship at Perceptronics Solutions. While there, I researched potential ML solutions to a problem with a positioning system and ultimately implemented a paper, improving location accuracy in GPS-denied environments by over 55% using an RNN to perform time series forecasting of the expected location error and correcting for it.

Before that, I worked as a software/DDR5 memory engineer during an internship at Intel. There, I performed post-silicon validation on server-grade DDR5 DRAM. To optimize the validation pipeline, I wrote a genetic algorithm in python to find optimal duty cycle adjust settings to minimize electrical jitter before validating, reducing the average search time by ~80% and discovering settings with ~50% less electrical jitter than previous methods.


## 👨‍💻 Courses

As a graduate student, I'm focusing on computer architecture and AI/ML. Specifically, I'm taking classes related to advanced architecture (SOTA CPU design, advanced memory hierarchy, branch prediction, etc.), ML (data selection, distributed training, quantization, pruning), and others like quantum programming.

During undergrad at UCLA, I studied computer engineering and math. In addition to the basics, I spent most of my undergrad focusing on AI/ML classes. Specifically, I've taken courses in computer vision, NLP, deep learning, and AI theory (propositional and first order logic, Bayesian statistics, etc.). I bring my math background to these classes, most notably through game theory and graph theory.

Additionally, I've taken courses in SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and cryptography/blockchain.
