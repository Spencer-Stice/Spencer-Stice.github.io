üéì I'm a senior at UCLA studying computer engineering and math. I'm planning on attending UCLA grad school for computer science, but I'm open to other opportunities!

üî¨ I'm primarily interested in AI/ML, computer architecture, blockchain, and SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). I'm planning to focus on ML software in addition to hardware accelerators during grad school.

Most recently, I worked as an AI Researcher during an internship at Perceptronics Solutions. While there, I researched ML solutions to a problem with a positioning system and ultimately implemented a NARX neural network in Tensorflow based on a research paper to improve the system's accuracy.

Before that, I worked as a software/DDR5 memory engineer during and internship at Intel. There, I worked on validating server-grade DDR5 DRAM as efficiently as possible. After researching bottlenecks in the pipeline, I implemented a genetic algorithm in Python to obtain optimal duty cycle adjust (DCA) settings faster.
