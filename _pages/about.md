üéì I'm a computer science master's student at UCLA. I'm looking for full time roles following graduation.

üî¨ I'm primarily interested in computer architecture and AI/ML, although I have an interest in blockchain as well.

# Selected Experience

## üë®‚Äçüíª Academic Research

I'm currently working in Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman's Large Scale Machine Learning Group (BigML) Lab as a graduate researcher. Here, I research techniques to prevent LLMs from losing their RLHF alignment during task-specific fine tuning. I'm looking into ideas from neural network interpretability and pruning to preserve the model alignment.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Industry

Most recently, I worked as an AI Researcher during an internship at Perceptronics Solutions. While there, I researched potential ML solutions to a problem with a positioning system and ultimately implemented a paper, improving location accuracy in GPS-denied environments by over 55% using an RNN to perform time series forecasting of the expected location error and correcting for it.

Before that, I worked as a software/DDR5 memory engineer during an internship at Intel. There, I performed post-silicon validation on server-grade DDR5 DRAM. To optimize the validation pipeline, I wrote a genetic algorithm in python to find optimal duty cycle adjust settings to minimize electrical jitter before validating, reducing the average search time by ~80% and discovering settings with ~50% less electrical jitter than previous methods.


## üë®‚Äçüíª Courses

As a graduate student, I'm focusing on computer architecture and AI/ML. Specifically, I'm taking classes related to advanced architecture (GPU microarchitecture, advanced memory hierarchy, branch prediction, simulation based evaluation), ML (distributed training, quantization, pruning), and others like quantum programming.

During undergrad at UCLA, I studied computer engineering and math. In addition to the basics, I spent most of my undergrad focusing on AI/ML classes. Specifically, I've taken courses in computer vision, NLP, deep learning, and AI theory (propositional and first order logic, Bayesian statistics, etc.). I bring my math background to these classes, most notably through game theory and graph theory.

Additionally, I've taken courses in SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and cryptography/blockchain.
