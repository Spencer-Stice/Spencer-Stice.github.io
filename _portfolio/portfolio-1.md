The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately classifies electroencephalograph (EEG) data into four different classes based on motor imaginary tasks: moving the left hand, right hand, both feet, or tongue. Our investigation analyzes and compares the performance of CNN, RNN, CNN+LSTM, and ResNet architectures as well as the pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning techniques we used. After tuning, we achieved our highest test accuracy of 69.3% on all subjects and 80.0% on subject #3 using our CNN+LSTM model.
