The goal of this project is implement an effective test suite of data preprocessing and post processing for use with Microsoft's Phi-2 language model. I use the Huggingface transformers library and Google Cloud Compute to access the model and required GPUs for running model inference. Using the test suite/pipeline, I evaluated the performance of the model on classification tasks.
